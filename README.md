# Cars-Middle-East
This project was for Data Science II at Univeristy of Houston for Spring 2021. It is split into two phases: Phase I is about data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA; Phase 2 is about Hyperparameter Tuning and model performance. The goal of the project is to predict the price of a car in the Middle East based on the features or parts in the car.
